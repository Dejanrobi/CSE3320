Our Life is like a thorny rose
Not perfect, but always beautiful
The thorns represent the hardships in our lives
The delicate red petals represent the fun and beautiful things in our lives

Our Life is like a thorny rose
Not perfect, but always beautiful
The Birds in the sky oh how they fly
I do want to fly while writing this OS Project.
